# ML for Global Development Working Group

Radiant.Earth has formed a technical working group of leading experts and organizations on the topic of “Machine Learning for Global Development”. This group will gather in thought leadership forums to discuss and develop best practices and standards to further the use of Machine Learning (ML) and Earth Observations (EO) to advance global development. Participants include representatives from different government, non-profit, commercial and academic organizations. The goal is to collaborate on developments of new algorithms, standards and training data for ML applications to Earth observation data.

First gathering of the ML4GD working group is the "Machine Learning for Global Land Cover Classification" workshop hosted on June 14-15, 2018 in Washington, DC.
