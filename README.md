# ML for Global Development Working Group

Radiant Earth Foundation is a non-profit organization with a mission to improve discovery, access, delivery, and application of open geospatial resources in support of the global development community (GDC). Radiant Earth Foundation accomplishes these objectives by integrating and exploiting the latest in Earth Observation (EO) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques through engagement with the development community, commercial and academic experts to achieve this goal.

To this end, Radiant Earth has formed a technical working group of leading experts and organizations on the topic of **“Machine Learning for Global Development”**. This group will gather in thought leadership forums to discuss and develop best practices and standards to further the use of ML and EO to advance global development. Participants include representatives from different government, non-profit, commercial and academic organizations. The goal is to collaborate on developments of new algorithms, standards and training data for ML applications to Earth observation data.

First gathering of the ML4GD working group was the ["Machine Learning for Global Land Cover Classification"](/06142018-washington-dc/README.md) workshop hosted on June 14-15, 2018 in Washington, DC.
