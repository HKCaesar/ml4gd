# Machine Learning for Global Land Cover Classification

Radiant.Earth is hosting a 2 day technical workshop 14-15 June, 2018 in Washington, D.C. Goal is to discuss and develop specifications for the global LC labeled training dataset by aggregating inputs from all participants. 

##Expected Outcomes:
 * Generating an inclusive hierarchical taxonomy of LC classes at global scale;
 * Defining specifications of the signature library for labeling and metadata storage;
 * Reviewing, examining and documenting best practices for using ML with satellite imagery for LC classification; and
 * Identifying knowledge gaps.


# Workshop Structure

To achieve the goals of this meeting, three topic-specific working groups will address the following during the breakout sessions:

 * Working Group 1: Land Cover Taxonomy
This group focuses on developing the hierarchical LC class taxonomy. Participants will use current taxonomies as a baseline, and develop the globally inclusive LC class taxonomy which has a hierarchical structure.
 * Working Group 2: Machine Learning Algorithms
This group will review and document best practices in using ML for LC classification. A non- inclusive list of the topics to be discussed are:
  * How to achieve higher accuracies within each class, and between different classes?
  * What should be the metric for measuring training data diversity?
  * How to improve the quality of training data?
(Additional topics may emerge from the morning session).
 * Working Group 3: Training data specifications
This group will develop specifications for LC labels to be stored in the imagery metadata. The goal would be to use the Spatio-Temporal Asset Catalogue (STAC) for this purpose, and design specifications for labels to be stored in imagery with Cloud-Optimized Geotiff (COG) format.
